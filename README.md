# Four projects in computational mathematics, with Python code.
- Project 1 Finding Zeros
Comparisons of three well-known methods for finding the zeros of functions. Estimation of Series by truncation compared with alternative recursion techniques.

- Project 2 Interpolation Methods
Matlab vizualization of interpolation methods. Estimating integrals via the composite trapezoid rule, Simpsonâ€™s rule, and Gaussian quadrature.

- Project 3 Efficient Matrix Solvers
Iterative Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Richardson, CG and GMRES methods on large matrix systems with and without preconditioner. Various preconditioners considered.

- Project 4 Advanced Preconditioning in PDE}
Advanced preconditioners applied in a finite difference method for a schrodinger equation.
